# Project Name
WhatNow

# Description 
WhatNow is a web app that uses an IBM Watson powered chatbot to help users find food and events in Seattle. It employs a MySql DB to store the interactions with its users and is deployed via Heroku. 

# Road Map
Currently, the responses of Watson are deployed via our own interal suggestion data in the future we would like to connect the chat bot to live api's so as to serve up real time content to users.
